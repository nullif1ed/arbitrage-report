\section{Definition of Spread}

Let
\[
P_{\mathrm{Bin}}(t), \qquad P_{\mathrm{Coin}}(t)
\]
be the instantaneous prices for Bitcoin on Binance and Coinbase.  
The price spread is defined as:
\[
s(t) = P_{\mathrm{Bin}}(t) - P_{\mathrm{Coin}}(t).
\]

This document provides a self-contained theoretical model for the evolution of $s(t)$.

\section{Stochastic Delay Model}

We consider the following stochastic delay differential equation (SDDE) for the spread:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sde_delay}
\frac{ds(t)}{dt}
= -\kappa \big(s(t) - \mu\big)
  - \gamma\, s(t-\tau)
  + \sigma \,\xi(t),
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\kappa > 0$ is the instantaneous mean-reversion rate,
    \item $\mu$ is the long-run average spread,
    \item $\gamma \ge 0$ is the delayed feedback (arbitrage pressure acting with latency),
    \item $\tau > 0$ is the latency or reaction delay,
    \item $\sigma > 0$ is the noise amplitude,
    \item $\xi(t)$ is white noise.
\end{itemize}

The term $-\kappa(s(t)-\mu)$ captures short-term reversion, while $-\gamma s(t-\tau)$ models arbitrageurs correcting mispricings with finite delay.

\section{Ornstein--Uhlenbeck Special Case}

If $\gamma = 0$, the model reduces to the classical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process:
\begin{equation}
ds(t) = -\kappa (s(t)-\mu)\,dt + \sigma\,dW_t,
\end{equation}
with $W_t$ a Wiener process.

The OU process is mean-reverting and Gaussian, making it a standard baseline for spread modeling.

\section{Discrete-Time Approximation}

For observations sampled at interval $\Delta t$, the Euler–Maruyama discretization of \eqref{eq:sde_delay} is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:disc_full}
s_{n+1}
=
s_n
- \kappa (s_n - \mu)\Delta t
- \gamma s_{n-\ell}\Delta t
+ \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}\,\varepsilon_n,
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_n \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $\ell = \tau/\Delta t$ is the integer delay.

\subsection{OU Discrete Form}

If $\gamma=0$, \eqref{eq:disc_full} becomes the AR(1) representation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ar1}
s_{n+1}
= \phi s_n + (1-\phi)\mu + \eta_n,
\qquad
\phi = 1 - \kappa \Delta t,
\end{equation}
with innovations $\eta_n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \Delta t)$.

\section{Critical Delay and Stability}

Ignoring noise, the delay-only equation:
\[
\dot{s}(t) = -\gamma s(t-\tau)
\]
has characteristic equation:
\[
\lambda + \gamma e^{-\lambda \tau} = 0.
\]

A pair of purely imaginary roots appears when:
\[
\tau = \tau_c = \frac{\pi}{2\gamma}.
\]

Thus:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $\tau < \tau_c$, the spread is stable and returns toward $0$.
    \item If $\tau > \tau_c$, oscillations can arise due to delayed arbitrage reaction.
\end{itemize}

In the general case with both $\kappa$ and $\gamma$, stability boundaries require numerical root finding for:
\[
\lambda + \kappa + \gamma e^{-\lambda \tau} = 0.
\]

\section{Simulation Equation}

To simulate the stochastic spread dynamics, use the discrete form:
\[
s_{n+1}
=
s_n
+
\left[-\kappa(s_n - \mu)
      - \gamma s_{n-\ell}\right]\Delta t
+ \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}\,\varepsilon_n.
\]

Initial conditions $s_0, s_1, \dots, s_\ell$ can be set from historical data or through a short burn-in period.

\section{Summary}

This standalone document provides a complete stochastic and delay-based model for cryptocurrency exchange price spreads. The model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item incorporates mean-reversion,
    \item includes latency-induced feedback,
    \item provides a stability condition via critical delay $\tau_c$,
    \item supports simulation through a discrete stochastic update rule.
\end{itemize}
